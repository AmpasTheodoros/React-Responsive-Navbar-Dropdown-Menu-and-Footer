# React Responsive Navbar, Dropdown Menu, and Footer

This repository contains a responsive navbar, dropdown menu, and footer built using React. The components are designed to be easily customizable and can be used in any website or app.

## Getting Started

To use the components, clone or download the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the development server. The components can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features

- The navbar component includes a logo, a search bar, and a list of links that can be customized.
- The navbar component is responsive and will adjust to fit different screen sizes, including mobile and tablet.
- The navbar component includes a dropdown menu that can be triggered by clicking on the hamburger icon.
- The footer component includes a logo, a list of links, and social media icons that can be customized.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the components such as:

- The ability to customize the colors and fonts of the components.
- The ability to add additional elements to the navbar and footer, such as a login form or a newsletter signup.
- The ability to integrate the components with a back-end API or a database.
